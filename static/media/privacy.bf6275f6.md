Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

Bears Lairs retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide our services, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations and resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements. Actual periods of retention can vary significantly for different types of data, given the circumstances. If you have only enquired with us, your personal data will be retained for a period of no longer than 6 months.

Once a contract has ended between a customer and Bears Lairs, we may ask for a short survey to be completed. This will be requested within 14 days of the end of a contract. This will be the last time contact is made, unless the survey response requires our attention.

CCTV images are never stored for a period of more than one month, and call recordings are retained only for a three month period.

#### How Bears Lairs protects your information

When you contact us for a quote for our services, we offer the use of a secure server that we host offsite with a GDPR compliant company.

Specifically, we shall permit only authorised employees, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our Privacy Policy are subject to our usual disciplinary procedures.
