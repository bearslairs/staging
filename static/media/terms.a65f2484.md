##### Disposal of Goods

The Prompt Payment of each and every sum (including interest), owing from You to us from time to time under this Agreement or any other agreement between You and us (in this Condition, called ‘Your Debt’) is of the essence of this Agreement.

The terms of this Condition are additional to and without prejudice to all or any rights we may have at common law or otherwise.

In default of Prompt Payment of Your Debt, We are relieved of any duty howsoever arising in respect of the Goods; and the Goods are held solely at Your risk and we shall be able to immediately exercise the lien described below.

We have a lien over the Goods for Your Debt. Until payment of Your Debt in full has been received by Us by credit or debit card, or a direct bank transfer, and after this lien becomes exercisable by Us, the following Conditions shall apply.
* You shall pay Us fees and charges at the same rates as under this Agreement and if this Agreement has been terminated, the relevant rate at which such fees and charges will be payable by You will be the rate which was payable immediately prior to termination;
* In default of Prompt Payment of Your Debt, You authorise Us:
  * to refuse You and Your agents’ access to the Goods, the Unit and the Site;
  * to enter the Unit and inspect and remove the Goods to another unit or Site;
  * to hold on to and/or ultimately dispose of some or all of The Goods.

In the event that Your Debt is not paid promptly or You fail to collect the Goods after we have required You to collect them or upon expiry or termination of this Agreement, we may, subject to Cthe conditions of this Agreement, sell the Goods and pass all ownership to them and use the proceeds to the sale to pay first the costs incurred by Us in the sale and removal, and secondly in paying Your Debt and to hold any balance for You. Interest will not accrue on the balance.

If the proceeds of sale are insufficient to discharge all or any part of the costs of sale incurred by Us and Your Debt, You must pay any balance outstanding to Us within seven days of a written demand from Us which will set out the balance remaining due to Us after the net proceeds of sale have been credited to You. Interest will continue to accrue on Your Debt until payment has been made.

Before we sell the Goods, we will give You notice in writing by registered or recorded delivery post at Your address as stated on the Licence Agreement or any address notified by You to Us in writing prior to our notice and/or electronically to the email address given to Us by You, specifying any particulars that we have of the Goods, the amount of Your Debt at the date of the notice (and, in our sole discretion, specifying any amount by which Your Debt is increasing after the date of that notice) and directing You to pay and that in default of payment within four weeks after the date of the notice, we will sell The Goods. We do not agree to give You any further notice of any intended sale of The Goods.

An Auction Notice will incur a minimum лв20 BGN administrative fee.

We will sell the Goods by the best method(s) reasonably available to achieve the best selling price reasonably obtainable in the open market, taking into account the costs of sale.

If the Goods cannot reasonably and economically be sold (for any reason whatsoever), or they remain unsold despite our efforts, You authorise Us to treat them as abandoned by You and to destroy or otherwise dispose of them at Your cost.

Bears Lairs will retain any items or materials found within the unit that contain personal information or data. These items will not be sold under any circumstances. All reasonable effort will be made to return the items to The Customer. In the event that The Customer cannot be reached, any item containing personal data will be securely destroyed and a certificate of destruction retained by Us.

In the event that You do not pay any Fees or charges, the Goods are left in the Unit at Your sole risk. We exclude any liability in respect of the Goods when payment of Our Fees or charges is overdue and exclude any duty of care howsoever arising

Our Fees (excluding any applicable taxes) will remain unchanged for the first six months of this Agreement. After that period, We reserve the right to periodically review the charges and fees. Reviewed charges and fees are applicable 30 days after written notice is provided by Us.

##### Insurance

We do not insure Goods whilst they are on Site, although note that We can arrange insurance cover for You.

You warrant to Us as follows:

That prior to bringing the Goods onto the Site You have insured the Goods against all Normal Perils (as set out below) under a valid contract of insurance either through a reputable insurance company for their full replacement value and will not cause or allow that insurance cover to lapse whilst the Goods remain on the Site.

You acknowledge that You shall be responsible for all uninsured risks; and that Normal Perils in this Condition mean loss of or damage to Goods caused by fire, lightning, explosion, earthquake, aircraft, storm, flood, bursting or leaking pipes, ingress of water or other liquid substance, theft accompanied by forcible and violent entry or exit, riot, strike, civil commotion, malicious damage, and impact by vehicles or rolling railway stock.

You also warrant that the insurance cover will not be for a sum which is lower than the replacement value of the Goods stored in the Unit from time to time.

In the case that insurance is not arranged by Us, You agree to obtain insurance through a reputable insurance company. Such insurance must include a clause for the benefit of Bears Lairs under which all rights of recourse towards Bears Lairs, Bears Lairs’s insurers and co-contractors are waived by Your insurer. As long as such certificate has not been delivered, You must subscribe to the insurance policy offered by Us.

You will always hold Bears Lairs, Bears Lairs’s insurers and co-contractors harmless and indemnified from any claims by the customer’s insurers for recourse against Bears Lairs.

The storage of the Goods in the storage Unit is and remains always at the sole risk of the Customer.

Bears Lairs EOOD shall not be liable for any damage to the Goods whatsoever, nor shall Bears Lairs EOOD be liable for any property damage or for any economic loss of the Customer.

Any such insurance cover that You take out must provide protection that is equal to or better than the cover offered by the policy arranged by Us.

We do not give any advice concerning such insurance, and it is for You to make Your own judgement whether such insurance is appropriate to cover the Goods and risks to them.

If We have told You that You are required to hold public liability insurance, You will provide Us with evidence of Your public liability insurance and a copy of the policy upon Our request. You will not allow any such insurance cover We require You to hold to lapse through the Licence Agreement.

Inspection by Us of any insurance documents provided by You to demonstrate cover does not mean that We have approved the cover or confirmed it is sufficient.

You will be liable for and You will compensate Us for the full amount of all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses incurred by Us or by any of Our employees, agents or other Site users or licensees or persons at the Site which arise out of:

* The use of the Unit or the Site by You or any of Your employees, agents or invitees (including relating to the ownership or storage of Goods in the Unit);
* Your breach of this Licence or a breach by any of Your agents; 
* Any dispute as to the ownership of the Unit or as to the person who is entitled by law to have possession of the Unit;
* Our enforcement of any of the Conditions of this Licence.

We exclude all liability in respect of loss or damage relating to Your business, if any, including consequential loss, lost profits or business interruption, and all liability in respect of loss or damage to the Goods caused by Normal Perils, including as a result of negligence by Us, our agents and/or employees above the sum of лв100 BGN which we consider to be the normal excess on a standard household insurance policy whether or not that policy would cover The Goods.

We do not exclude liability for physical injury to or the death of any person and which is a direct result of our negligence of wilful default or that of our agents and/or employees.

You will indemnify Us against all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses incurred by Usor by any of our servants, agents or other Unit Customers or persons on the Site which arise out of the use of the Unit or the Site by You or any of Your servants, agents or invitees or arise out of the breach of this Agreement by You.

In the event of circumstances which are outside our reasonable control and their consequences, we do not agree and are not obliged by this Agreement to maintain the safety or security of the Goods, the Unit or the Site in order to keep the Goods free from damage or loss.

Neither You nor We shall have any liability under or be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement for any delay or failure in performance of this Agreement that results from circumstances beyond the reasonable control of that party. Such circumstances include any Act of God, riot, strike or lock-out, trade dispute or labour disturbance, accident, breakdown of plant or machinery, fire, flood, shortage of labour, materials or transport, electrical power failures, threat of or actual terrorism or environmental or health emergency or hazard, or entry into any unit including the Unit or the Site by, or arrest or seizure or confiscation of Goods by competent authorities

Bears Lairs do not insure motorbikes. If you are storing a motorbike at a location where motorbike storage is permitted by Us, you must ensure that the motorbike has adequate insurance cover. Bears Lairs are not liable for any damage or loss to a motorbike.

##### Safety Notices

Entering and leaving the storage facility Customers are provided with a personal access code or key to the Site, which must be used every time the Customer wants to access the Unit. We do not permit the following of another customer / vehicle inside or outside the Site without having entered the access code or using the key. The Customer needs to ensure that the doors and gates are closed after entering or leaving.
